# Iris (Library)

To the best of my knowledge this colour library does something that others do not.

## Done
- converter logic
- basic helpers
- type definitions
- html/css integration tools
- colour parsing to match types
- accessibility checker
- contrast checker
- remove null options from converters IMPORTANT
- add two more converter functions MOST IMPORTANT
- colour creator factory!! IMPORTANT
- added inversion
- added complement
- implement max palette size logic
- fixed colour/palette-type generators e.g., monotone, tints, triadic, analagous
- update white/black/gray tolerance to be consistent i.e., 100 - x where necessary
- spectrum i.e., get from colour A to colour B
- grayscale - requires factory function

## To Do
- additional spectrum options i.e., 3 and 4 colours
- additional palettes - complementary colours, mixed stuff.

## Extensions
- custom palette definitions
- prune, iterate over a palette given some given colour and remove colours that fail contrast/accessibility checks?
