# Iris (Library)

To the best of my knowledge this colour library does something that others do not.
## Done
- converter logic
- basic helpers
- type definitions
- html/css integration tools
- colour parsing to match types
- accessibility checker
- contrast checker

## To Do
- grayscale and inversion functions - requires factory function
- more sophisticated constrast checker
- fixed colour/palette-type generators e.g., monotone, tints, triadic, analagous, complementary
- colour creator factory!! IMPORTANT
- add two more converter functions MOST IMPORTANT

## Extensions
- generic palette definitions
- spectrum i.e., get from colour A to colour B
